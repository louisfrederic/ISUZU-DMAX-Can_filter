  *		This is a program to correct the displayed speed of the speedometer. 
  *		I had to adjust my speedometer because I installed bigger tires.
  *
  *		The ÂµC makes a man in the middle attack and recalculates the values in
  *		the CAN message. The correction factor is stored in the "cor_val" variable.
  *		To display 6% more on the speedo -> cor_val = 1.06
  *		To display 7% less on the speedo -> cor_val = 0.93
